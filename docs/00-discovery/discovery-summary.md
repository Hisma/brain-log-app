### Technical Debt Identified

#### 1. Form Modification Complexity
**Issue**: Modifying forms requires changes across multiple files and database schema updates
**Impact**: Slows feature development and increases maintenance overhead
**Recommendation**: Implement dynamic form generation system or form builder pattern

#### 2. UI Consistency Challenges
**Issue**: Mix of custom CSS components and shadcn/ui components
**Impact**: Inconsistent design system and maintenance difficulties
**Recommendation**: Standardize on shadcn/ui or create unified design system

#### 3. Backend Architecture Inconsistency
**Issue**: Mix of custom code and Next.js standard features
**Impact**: Reduced maintainability and flexibility
**Recommendation**: Establish consistent patterns and architectural guidelines

#### 4. Security Simplicity
**Issue**: Basic user registration system without admin controls
**Impact**: No user access management or administrative oversight
**Recommendation**: Implement role-based access control and admin panel

## Architecture Patterns Analysis

### Hybrid Runtime Implementation
The application successfully implements a sophisticated hybrid runtime pattern:

**Edge Runtime Components**:
- Middleware for global authentication
- Edge-compatible cryptographic utilities
- Minimal database access for authentication

**Node.js Runtime Components**:
- Full-featured API endpoints
- Complex business logic
- Prisma ORM for comprehensive database operations

**Benefits Realized**:
- Global authentication performance
- Scalable architecture
- Cost-effective resource usage
- Reduced origin server load

### Database Strategy
Dual-database access pattern providing optimal performance:

**Edge Runtime**: Direct SQL via Neon serverless driver
**Node.js Runtime**: Prisma ORM with connection pooling
**Result**: Fast authentication with full ORM capabilities for business logic

### Authentication Architecture
Three-layer authentication system:
1. **Edge Middleware**: Global request filtering and redirects
2. **API Authentication**: Full database user lookup and session creation  
3. **Client Authentication**: Safe client-side session management

## Strategic Recommendations

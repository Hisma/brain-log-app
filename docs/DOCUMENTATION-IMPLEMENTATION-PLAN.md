# Documentation Implementation Plan - Hybrid Approach

## Overview

This document outlines a structured approach to implementing comprehensive internal documentation for the Brain Log App using a hybrid structure that combines user-centric organization with analytical depth. The plan is designed for single-maintainer workflow and focuses on creating professional, maintainable documentation that reflects the current state of the application and can evolve with the codebase.

## Documentation Objectives

- **Current State Documentation**: Accurately document the application as it exists today
- **User-Centric Organization**: Prioritize developer onboarding and task-oriented documentation
- **Evolution-Ready**: Create documentation structure that can be updated as the application grows
- **Professional Standards**: Implement modern software development documentation practices
- **Internal Use**: Maintain confidentiality while supporting development and feature addition
- **Single Maintainer Focused**: Streamlined processes suitable for one-person maintenance

## Document Structure Standards

### File Naming Convention
- Use kebab-case for all files: `system-architecture.md`
- Include numerical prefixes for ordering: `01-system-overview.md`
- Use descriptive names that indicate content purpose

### Document Template Structure
```markdown
---
title: Document Title
description: Brief description of document purpose
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
version: X.Y.Z
status: draft|review|final
---

# Document Title

## Overview
Brief overview of the document's purpose and scope

## [Content Sections]
Main content organized in logical sections

## Related Documents

└── 10-reference/         # Reference materials and guides
```

## Quality Standards

### Content Requirements
- **Accuracy**: All code examples must be tested and current
- **Completeness**: Document all major functionality and components
- **Clarity**: Use clear, concise language appropriate for technical audience
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology and formatting
- **Currency**: Regular updates to reflect codebase changes

### Document Metadata
Each document must include:
- Creation date
- Last updated date
- Version number
- Current status (draft/review/final)
- Brief description of purpose

### Review Process
- Self-review for accuracy and completeness
- Test all code examples and procedures
- Verify links and cross-references
- Update related documents when making changes

## Implementation Approach

### Single Document Focus
Work on one document at a time to maintain quality and focus:
1. Complete discovery for specific area
2. Create document outline
3. Write content in sections
4. Review and test content
5. Finalize and mark as complete
6. Move to next document

### Discovery Documentation
During Phase 1, create temporary discovery documents in `/docs/00-discovery/` to capture:
- Code analysis findings
- Component inventories
- Configuration details
- Technical notes and observations

These discovery documents will inform the creation of official documentation and can be archived once official docs are complete.

### Version Control Integration
- Treat documentation as code with proper version control
- Use meaningful commit messages for documentation changes
- Tag documentation versions alongside code releases
- Maintain changelog for significant documentation updates

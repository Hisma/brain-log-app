# AI Insights Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding AI-powered insights to the Brain Log App. The feature will analyze daily log data using OpenAI's GPT-4.1 model to provide personalized insights, patterns, and recommendations to users.

## Goals

- Provide users with AI-generated insights based on their daily log data
- Identify patterns and correlations in user's mental health, medication effects, and daily activities
- Offer personalized recommendations to improve well-being
- Create a clean, intuitive UI for viewing and interacting with insights

## Technical Approach

### 1. Backend Implementation

#### 1.1 Database Schema Updates

- Create a new `Insight` model in the Prisma schema:
  ```prisma
  model Insight {
    id              Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
    userId          Int
    dailyLogId      Int
    insightText     String   @db.Text
    createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
    
    // Relationships
    user            User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
    dailyLog        DailyLog @relation(fields: [dailyLogId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
    
    @@index([userId])
    @@index([dailyLogId])
    @@unique([userId, dailyLogId])
  }
  ```

- Run database migrations:
  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate dev --name add_insights
  ```

#### 1.2 OpenAI Integration Service

- Create a new service for OpenAI API integration:
  - File: `src/lib/services/openaiService.ts`
  - Functionality:
    - Initialize OpenAI client with API key
    - Format daily log data into prompts
    - Send requests to GPT-4.1
    - Process and return AI-generated insights

#### 1.3 API Endpoints

- Create new API routes for insights:
  - `POST /api/insights` - Generate and store insights for a daily log
  - `GET /api/insights` - Retrieve insights for a user or specific daily log

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### 2.1 UI Components

- Create insight-related components:
  - `DailyInsightCard.tsx` - Display insights for a specific day
  - Add insight generation button to daily log completion page

#### 2.2 Insights Page

- Create a dedicated insights page:
  - File: `src/app/insights/page.tsx`
  - Features:
    - Select daily logs from a dropdown
    - View AI-generated insights for selected log
    - Generate insights on demand if not already available

### 3. Integration Points

- Add insights button to daily log completion page
- Add insights link to main navigation
- Consider notifications for new insights

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

- [ ] Set up OpenAI API integration
- [ ] Create database schema for insights
- [ ] Implement basic API endpoints
- [ ] Create simple UI components for displaying insights

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Week 2)

- [ ] Implement prompt engineering for optimal insights
- [ ] Create insights page with daily log selection
- [ ] Add insight generation button to daily log completion
- [ ] Implement error handling and loading states

### Phase 3: Refinement (Week 3)

- [ ] Optimize prompts for better insights
- [ ] Add caching for API responses
- [ ] Improve UI/UX for insights display
- [ ] Add user feedback mechanism for insights

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Future)

- [ ] Implement weekly and monthly insight summaries
- [ ] Add visualization of patterns and trends
- [ ] Create notification system for new insights
- [ ] Develop personalized recommendation engine

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies

- OpenAI SDK: `npm install openai`
- React Markdown: `npm install react-markdown`

### Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - API key for OpenAI

## Testing Plan

- Unit tests for OpenAI service functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- UI tests for insights components
- End-to-end tests for the complete insights flow

## Monitoring and Analytics

- Track insight generation usage
- Monitor OpenAI API costs
- Collect user feedback on insight quality
- Analyze patterns in user engagement with insights

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| OpenAI API costs | Medium | Implement caching, rate limiting, and usage tracking |
| Poor quality insights | High | Refine prompts, collect user feedback, implement quality checks |
| API rate limits | Medium | Add retry logic, queue system for high traffic |
| Privacy concerns | High | Ensure all data processing follows privacy policy, no data stored by OpenAI |

## Success Metrics

- User engagement with insights feature
- Reported usefulness of insights (via feedback)
- Correlation between insight usage and app retention
- Improvement in user-reported mental health metrics

## Documentation

- Update API documentation with new endpoints
- Create user guide for insights feature
- Document prompt engineering approach for future refinement
